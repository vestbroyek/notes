## Where to find information
The main sources of information should always be the datasheet and the reference manual. The datasheet summarises the physical specs, memory map, etc., whereas the reference manual is about how to use the memory and peripherals. 

Additionally, we can refer to the reference manual for the Arm Cortex M4, and the programming manual.
